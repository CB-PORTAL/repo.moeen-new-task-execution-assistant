# Moeen AI - Intelligent Instruction Execution Assistant

Welcome to the Moeen AI project! Moeen is an AI-powered virtual assistant that intelligently interprets natural language instructions and autonomously executes them, streamlining workflows and boosting productivity.

## Project Vision

Moeen AI aims to provide a seamless way for users to translate written instructions into executable actions, all with a simple highlight and right-click. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) and browser automation, Moeen will be your go-to tool for automating repetitive tasks and navigating complex workflows.

## Key Features (In Development)

- Instruction Parsing: Highlight text instructions on any webpage for Moeen to analyze and understand.
- Intelligent Execution: With a single click, Moeen will autonomously carry out instructions, navigating websites, filling forms, and interacting with page elements.
- Chrome Extension: Moeen will be conveniently accessible right from your browser toolbar.
- Workflow Automation: From troubleshooting software issues to drafting emails, Moeen handles the grunt work while you focus on the bigger picture.

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: JavaScript (Chrome Extension)
- Backend: Python with Flask API
- NLP: spaCy for powerful, production-ready natural language processing
- Browser Automation: To be determined (possibly Puppeteer or Selenium)
- UI: React for an intuitive and responsive frontend

## Development Status

This project is in its initial development phase. Stay tuned for updates!
